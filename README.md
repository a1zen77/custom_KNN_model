In this project, a custom K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier was built from scratch using Python's Numpy library. The model uses Euclidean distance to find the nearest neighbors in the feature space and predict the class of a given input based on the majority class of the nearest neighbors.

The dataset used for evaluation is the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning that consists of 150 samples from three different species of Iris flowers, with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Was able to achieve accuracy of 96.6%
